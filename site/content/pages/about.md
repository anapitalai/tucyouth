## About BILUMS

Bilum in Papua New Guinea describes both the iconic string bag and the rhythmically repeated, controlled movement of the unique hand twisting to make the yarn and the looping of the finished yarn that requires no knots to make the bilum bag. Made exclusively by women but carried by all, the bilum is a utilitarian bag that is both functional and an expression of the creativity of women bilum weavers. Made in a variety of shapes and styles and created for different purposes, it is a traditional skilled craft passed from generation to generation. For centuries, the bilum bag has been made from natural strips of leaves, grasses or tree bark native to PNG, but since the introduction of wool in the 1930s and, more recently, synthetic fibers such as acrylic yarn and nylon string in a multitude of colours, this has become the yarn of choice that the skilled bilum Mamas have adopted to create an array of complex patterns.
